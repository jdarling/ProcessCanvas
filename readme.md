ProcessCanvas
==========

ProcessCanvas is a utility library for creating may different types of process flows and graphs.  It wraps up the HTML5 canvas object and provides many useful objects and methods for generating displays.

Status
-------

Right now ProcessCanvas works and works quite well, but it does need a lot of cleanup, documentation, test's written, and etc before it would be easy for the average developer to use it.  Hopefully I will get around to all of that, but until then feel free to look at the examples and the source code.

Sample usage
------------

See the example in examples/basic as a getting started point.
